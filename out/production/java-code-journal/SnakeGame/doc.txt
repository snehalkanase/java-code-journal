1. App.java
Purpose
This is the starting point of the program.

What it Does
Uses SwingUtilities.invokeLater() to safely start the UI.

Opens the main game window (GameBoard).

Key Points
main() launches the game screen.

The game UI runs on the Swing Event Dispatch Thread.

2. Direction.java
Purpose
Defines four directions the snake can move.

Values
UP
DOWN
LEFT
RIGHT
We use an enum to avoid typing strings repeatedly and to make directions type-safe.

3. GameBoard.java
Purpose
Creates the game window.

What is inside?
A window (JFrame) with a fixed size.

A GamePanel (the actual game drawing area).

Window is non-resizable and centered on screen.

Important Concepts

setPreferredSize() → sets screen resolution.

add(new GamePanel()) → attaches game display to window.

pack() → fits window to components.

setLocationRelativeTo(null) → centers window.

4. GamePanel.java
This is the heart of the game.
It:

Draws the snake and food

Handles movement

Detects collisions

Shows score

Handles game restart

Runs game loop using a timer

Let’s break it down.

Grid Settings
CELL_SIZE = 15
GRID_COLS = BOARD_WIDTH / CELL_SIZE
GRID_ROWS = BOARD_HEIGHT / CELL_SIZE
Meaning

The board is divided into small equal blocks (like tiles).
Each grid cell is 15x15 pixels.
All positions (snake and food) live on this grid.

Snake Representation
LinkedList<Point> snake = new LinkedList<>();

Each body segment is a Point(x, y) inside the grid.

First element → snake’s head.

Last element → snake’s tail.



Food

Point food;

Food is also a grid position.

Placed randomly on empty grid cells.

Game Engine
Timer timer;
Swing Timer fires an event every few milliseconds.

Each event updates the game (movement and repaint).

Keyboard Input
A key listener handles:

W / ↑ → Move Up

S / ↓ → Move Down

A / ← → Move Left

D / → → Move Right

R → Restart after game over

We prevent the snake from reversing direction instantly (e.g., going right then left immediately).

initGame()
This method:


Clears old snake

Places snake in middle of the board

Generates food

Starts the timer

placeFood()
This ensures:

Food appears inside the grid

Food never overlaps the snake

It keeps picking random coordinates until a valid empty spot is found.

Game Loop – actionPerformed()
Runs continuously:


If game is not over → move snake.

Then redraw everything.

updateGame()
This method:

1️⃣ Moves the snake head
Creates a new head based on current direction.

2️⃣ Checks wall collision
If head goes out of grid → game over.

3️⃣ Checks self collision
If head hits body → game over.

4️⃣ Checks win condition
If snake fills entire grid → game over.

5️⃣ Inserts new head
If head equals food → grow snake + increase score + place new food.

Otherwise → move normally by removing tail.

Drawing – paintComponent()
Handles all graphics:

Draws:
Food (Red circle)

Snake (Green blocks)

Score (Top-left)

Game Over message (when game ends)

Why repaint() works
Because Timer calls repaint → game refreshes continuously like animation.

Game Flow Summary


On Start:
Create snake in center

Place food

Start timer

Repeat every tick:
Move snake

Detect collisions

Grow or move tail

Redraw screen

If Collides:

Stop timer

Show GAME OVER message

Why This Project Is Good for Beginners
It teaches:

✔ Java classes & objects
✔ Using Swing for GUI
✔ Timer-based game loops
✔ Keyboard handling
✔ Drawing graphics
✔ Data structures (LinkedList)
✔ Collision logic
✔ Clean separation of concerns

Beginner Learning Takeaways

A simple game loop can be made using javax.swing.Timer

A snake can be represented as a list of grid positions

Graphics are drawn in paintComponent()

Games require constant screen updates using repaint()

Keyboard events are essential for interactive games
